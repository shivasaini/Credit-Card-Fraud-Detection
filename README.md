# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project is based on the detection of a fraudulent credit card transaction. The dataset contains over 5 lac data samples. For Exploratory Data Analysis, we used different pre-processing techniques like, correlation analysis, min-max scaling and NAN removal. We also used dataset balancing techniques like SMOTE and AdaSyn. For obtaining results we used one baseline model (Logistic Regression) and three advanced models (Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine) from which the best model was picked on the basis of results obtained on the basis of the accuracy score and the plotted ROC Curve.
